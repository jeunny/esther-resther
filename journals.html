        <h2>j.r. carpenter, the handmade web</h2>
        <h3>20.06.23<h3>
        	<p>The concept of a handmade web evokes a different kind of feeling than that of a pre-generated website. Becasue of our ever-evolving technology, there are less and less handmade websites and more and more generated websites. Technology is always improving and eventually designs and methods will become out of date and not look "cool", but the emotion and personality that is put into a handmade website will be there forever.</p>
