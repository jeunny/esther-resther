        <h2>j.r. carpenter, the handmade web</h2>
        <h3>20.06.23<h3>
        <p>The concept of a handmade web evokes a different kind of feeling than that of a pre-generated website. Becasue of our ever-evolving technology, there are less and less handmade websites and more and more generated websites. J.R. Carpenter's purpose is to use handmade websites to 1) "draw attention to the physical body", and 2) "suggest slowness and smallness as a forms of resistance". </p>
