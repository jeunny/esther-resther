            <h2>j.r. carpenter, the handmade web</h2>
        <h3>20.06.23<h3>
        	<p>The concept of a handmade web evokes a different kind of feeling than that of a pre-generated website. Becasue of our ever-evolving technology, there are less and less handmade websites and more and more generated websites. Technology is always improving and eventually designs and methods will become out of date and not look "cool", but the emotion and personality that is put into a handmade website will be there forever.</p>

        <h2>the internet's back-to-the-land movement<h2>
        <h3>24.06.23<h3>
            <p>The internet is considered a "sustainable alternative" compared to using physical paper/mailing, but ironically even the internet has its own physical space. Whether we realize it or not, we are all taking up space by using "the cloud".  HOWEVER... using a website could be actually be a more sustainable and mindful alternative. I was never really aware of this physical digital space, but hopefully we can also proceed to recreate those existing structures and build up with our handmade websites, our own private space.

            <p>There is a connection between art, architecture, and computation, in which they all use a certain design, repetition, and abstraction. I think Taeyoon demonstrates the connection between art and computation through the way he formatted the document itself; he includes physical drawings and paintings he created to incorporate into this short essay, giving it a "handmade" quality. Choi asks: <i>"What kind of computers do we want to use and what types of cities do we want to live in?" </i> And the same can be applied to ourselves as we create our own handmade websites - what do we want to see and how can we make it our own?</p>
